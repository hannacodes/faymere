     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>
       Glimnara, due to the cloud forest, is a very air oriented country. Their patron god is Vy, the god of the air. The main job amongst civilians is foragers or lumberjacks. They utilize the resources in their area, such as the many trees in the area. Because of their elemental magic, the Glimnarians are the only people in Faymere who can, essentially, fly. They use this power to harvest fruit that grows on the tall trees of Glimnara. The safest way to reach the capital city of Akzil is by water, or by following the river.

    <section class="government">
      <h2>Government</h2>
    
      <p>
        The center of operations in Glimnara is the capital city, Akzil. Glimnara's entire territory includes the Glimnara forest, which creates complications when there is a city on the other side of the forest. However, each city makes most of their decisions on the city wide level, and they must clear new laws with the government in Akzil, as well as have the majority of the city agree to pass the law.

      <h2>Exports</h2>
      <p>
        The Redroot Fairyoak, called Fairyoak for short, has some of the most resilient, yet lightweight wood. This wood is exported to Kevroc for their buildings, which need to handle the strength of the snow. Additionally, the forest grows the Silk Fern, which can be weaved into a synthethic silk for clothing. This commonly found plant allows Glimnara to be the fashion central of Faymere. In addition to fabric, Glimnara exports a lot of Yui Namira's famous fashion designs.

        Glimnarian fashion is known to be very bright and flashy. They take inspiration from the brightly colored wildlife that make their home in the Glimnara Woods. Glimnarians wear victorian style long coats, like the one pictured, made from the Silk Fern, which can be dyed into many colors. They import a variety of colors from different countries, like pink from Dyrrith, and blue from Levania. These coats protect them from the cold weather in the Glimnara Woods. In addition to the long coats, they wear scarves also made from the Silk Fern. They wear these scarves on their hair and/or around their necks. These scarves are usually patterned, and the richest Glimnarians can afford fashion from the top fashion designer in Faymere, Yui Namira.

      <h2>The God of The Air: Vy</h2>

       <p>Vy is the patron god of Glimnara, and the god of the air. She is also the god of peace, birds, communication, and flight. Vy's connection to the air is seen as how Glimnarians have the power to fly. Vy was said to have become the god of the wind after a tramatic event when she was younger, in which her two older brothers threw her off a cliff. Vy is said to appear as a specifically patterned bird. She can also appear in her humanoid form (pictured). Vy keeps to herself, and is seen as antisocial by the other gods. She believes birds are better than her fellow gods. To worship her, Glimnarians leave birdfood out for all of the birds, and in case Vy, in her bird form, needs a snack. Vy's temples are very open and free flowing. There are always birds flying in and out of there. However, Vy will have her revenge if a believer attacks a bird at all. She is said to strip the bird attacker of all powers. </p>

     <h2>The Glimnara Woods</h2>
     <p>
       The Glimnara Woods is, for all purposes, a cloud forest. However, the forest itself is shrouded in mystery. To successfully pass through the woods, you must follow the government approved path. If you deviate from the path in any way, your life is in the hands of the forest dwellers. The forest itself is home to a group of tree nymphs. These nymph's life force is tied to a group of trees in the heart of the forest. The nymphs are incredibly protective of their home due to this, and that is why the forest is so dangerous. Again, to survive in the forest, do not deviate from the path.

     <h2>Akzil</h2>
     <p>
       Akzil is the capital city of Glimnara. The residents of Akzil are known to be the most fashion forward people in Glimnara. Yui has many boutiques in this area, which makes it a popular tourist destination for the rich and famous. 50% of Glimnarians live here. The center of operations for Glimnara is located here, because it is the biggest city in Glimnara. Vy's largest temple is also located here. Akzil's main street is full of high end fashion boutiques. It is very expensive to live in Akzil's main street, and most of Akzil's residents live in the suburbs of Akzil.

       <p>Yui Namira is best known for her popular fashion label: Mira. She is seen as a fashion icon across Faymere, and her designs can be seen in almost every country. Her designs are very nature oriented, and she takes full advantage of Glimnara's nature aesthetic. She's a firm believer in Vy, and once a year she releases a limited edition design that honors Vy. She donates all the proceeds from that design to Vy's temple. Yui started design fashion when she was little. Her fabrics are hand weaved, and she makes sure that all of her workers are paid well and that they get breaks often. Yui did not expect to be so successful, and wants to give back to her community in some way. Her success in fashion has turned Glimnara into the fashion capital of Faymere. Yui loves designing, but she struggles with taking breaks. She tends to overwork herself when she gets a good idea. </p>
