     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>Emrachi is located above the Aidec Desert. The capital city of Emrachi is Trismuth. Their patron god is Fi, the god of Fire. Emrachi's climate is still quite dry and arid, but they have more access to water than Secium. Emrachi is seen to be constantly stuck in the season of fall. Their capital city is frequented by tourists because it lies on the gulf of three kingdoms, which connects Kevroc, Emrachi, and Levania.</p>

      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>
        Emrachi is run with a Democratic Republic form of government. People get to elect officials, but they do not get to vote on laws. There are 3 branches of Emrachi's government, and the heads of each branch's terms are only 3 years long. Other government official's terms last 6 years, and minor government workers do not have to be voted in, and they do not have a limited term.

      <p>
        Emrachi's trees are best known for their colorful leaves. Since they are stuck in a constant fall, their trees are full of the colorful leaves that are customary of fall. This leads to a lot of beautiful scenery in Emrachi, like the one pictured. Emrachians see their trees as channeling the colors of fire, and celebrate that their trees also honor Fi.

       <p>
         Fi is the patron god of Emrachi. He is also the god of fire. His other domains are smoke, combustion, and fireworks. He is not one of the main 3 gods, but he also has some followers in Dyrrith. He is said to appear in flame, and also has a human form. His human form has dark skin and red hair, almost burning. He is always blushing for absolutely no reason. He has a huge crush on the earth god, El. His best friend is Ki, and he is practically the polar opposite of her. He's impulsive and very extroverted. His temple always has a large fire burning in it. To worship him, followers burn messages in hopes that it will reach him.

      <h2>Trismuth</h2>
      <p>
        Trismuth is the capital of Emrachi. Trismuth was almost removed from being the capital after the great fire of Trismuth destroyed most of the city. The arsonist believed he was honoring Fi by burning the city down, but Fi was outraged. He stripped the man of his powers, and he sent him to prison for his crimes. Since then, Trismuth has honored Fi through rituals and a holiday that celebrates the end of the fire. To stop the fire, Fi was said to have needed the help from Lu and Ki, the water and ice gods. Trismuth honors both of them along with Fi on the anniversary of the fire.
