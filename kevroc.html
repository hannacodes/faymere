     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>Kevroc is the northern-most kingdom in Faymere. Their capital is Kolzi, and it lies in the leftmost side of Kevroc. Their patron god is Ki, the god of the snow. Due to the cold climate, Kevroc's only trees are evergreen trees. They import most of their foods, as they are almost stuck in an eternal winter. However, they have learned to embrace the snow, and they see the eternal winter as a blessing. The Kevrians can control the intensity of the snow, so they are not as impacted by the constant snowfall as someone who is not native to Kevroc would be. </p>

    <section class="government">
      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>
        Kevroc is ruled by the the queen of Kevroc, Stiri Kevroc. She is a relatively new queen, and has only been queen for two years. However, previously, she was well liked across the kingdom as the Princess of Kevroc. She runs it as a constitutional monarchy, and thus, does not have much law-making power in the country. She makes some important decisions, but leaves the others to her parliment. The parliment is comprised of people from all over Kevroc, but is based in the capital, Kolzi. The seats in parliament last for 4 years, and there is a countrywide election to determine who gets to keep their seats. People have no limits to their terms, but they must keep getting voted in to keep their seat. If they have one term and are voted out, they are not allowed to run for parliament for at least eight years.

    <section class="exports">
      <h2>Exports</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest export in Kevroc is jewelry. Kevrocians, with their ice magic, can make ice not melt. Thus, their jewelry is made with "immortal ice", a very sparkly jewel. They use metal mined from the Kiassi Alps in their jewelry. This metal, when polished, is incredibly shiny. The best gem maker in Kevroc has worked with the master metalworker from Highfall, and they created the most expensive jewelry that exists in Faymere. Kevroc also exports the Kianip jam, which is also sought after for people to eat for breakfast.

    <section class="plants">
      <h2>Plants</h2>
      <p>
       Kevroc has not very many plants, because few plants can survive the harsh conditions of Kevroc's constant snow. One of the most persistent plants is the snow milfoil. It grows on top of the snow, even if it cannot reach the ground beneath it. It was initially seen as an invasive species, but it has turned out to be immensely useful in protecting greenhouse plants from the snow. It is turned into a compost, and spread across the plants to encorage growth even in the coldest of climates. Kevroc grows a special fruit, called the Kianip, which can be made into a jam and preserved. It only grows in Kevroc's greenhouses, and is incredibly delicious, so it is highly sought after in other countries.

         Ki is the patron god of Kevroc, and also the god of the snow. Her other domains are ice, snowfall, mountains, and icicles. She is known across Koliz, and she has some worshippers in Dyrrith. She appears as a person with blue skin, blue eyes, and snow white hair. Her skin is said to be ice cold. She's not very communicative with the other gods, but is best friends with the god of fire. She cools him down from being too impulsive. Ki's main temple is made entirely out of ice. It is very cold in there.

      <h2>Kolzi</h2>
      <p>
        Kolzi is the capital of Kevroc. Stiri's palace is located here, as well as Ki's main temple. However, Kolzi is not known as a very good tourist destination, due to the harsh weather and extreme conditions. To trade, most people in Kevroc go to Highfall or Lenora.

       <p>
         The youngest queen in Kevroc's history, Stiri was 23 when her mother died of frostbite. Stiri was pitied because of the actions of her mother, and had to clean up what she did. The people of Kevroc see her as being too young to lead them, and they put a lot more faith in Parliament. Stiri wants to prove herself to her subjects, and she wants to show them that she can lead. The people closest to her think that she is incredibly cold, like the kingdom that she leads. However, she has a surprising amount of compassion for the poorest in Kevroc. She strives to make more shelters for the homeless, and aims to make sure that everyone survives Kevroc's harsh snowstorms.
