     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>Calis is a village on the edge of the Calis cove. It is separated from the Aidec desert by the Cails Cliffs. The people there are very secluded, and they rely on the cliffs and the cove to survive. Their patron god is Fi, who they learned from Emrachi, the first country to discover them. Calis is secluded, but the people are welcoming and hospitable. Calis has one inn, for visitors. Calis is quickly becoming a popular tourist destination for nobles and the upper class. Emrachians are the most prominent tourists there. Calis is seen as a peaceful destination for people who want to escape their busy everyday lives.  </p>

       <section class="government">
      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>
        Calis, because it is only one city, is run by the Mayor of Calis; Alaria Janus. Calis is seen as  a city-state by the rest of the countries, and Alaria and her team run practically all government operations in Calis. The city's government also has final say in any legal disputes. She has a team of social workers who help with homelessness, crime, and any other issues. She's respected by the majority of Calis' citizens, but some of Calis' residents believe they should go back into how it was before, when they were undisturbed.

      <h2>Tourism</h2>
      <p>
        Calis, to the rest of Faymere, is seen as a luxury vacation spot. It is a beachtown, and has a very calming atmosphere. People love to come here to escape from the rush of everyday life. The Levania family has a vacation home here, and they come here every summer to escape. They leave the most trusted of King Ailred's advisors in charge when they visit. The summer is Calis' busiest season of the year. Calis' businesses have been increasingly successful due to the tourism boom. Calis also capitalizes on tours of the gulf. Emrachi also offers cruises that take people to Calis.

      <p>
        Alaria Janus is the current mayor of Calis. She's very headstrong and determined. She is credited for making Calis the booming tourist city it is today. She's motivated to make her city the best that it can be. Alaria has lived in Calis for her entire life. She saw the city as something special, as something that should be shared with the rest of Faymere. She believes in all the gods, but she pays special tribute to Lu. She allows all of her citizens to worship whichever god they like, and because they get visitors from all around the world, Calis is full of many different people with powers, like Highfall. Some of the older people in Calis believe that Alaria should have kept Calis in hiding, and they do not believe that she should have become mayor at all. However, the majority of Calis sees her as someone who has allowed Calis to become the city it deserved to be.
