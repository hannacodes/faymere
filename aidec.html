     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>The Aidec Desert is surrounded by two mountain ranges, the Kiassi Alps, and the Cailis Cliffs. The climate is very dry and hot because the mountain ranges prevent much moisture from reaching the desert. In the center of the desert lies Secium. Secium is strategically placed next to an oasis, which provides it with water, shade, and plants. Secium is the only desert settlement in the Aidec Desert. The patron god of Secium is a lesser-known god, the god of the spirit, Si.  </p>

      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>
        Secium is the only part of the desert that needs a government. They do not have an official government system, but each year they elect a chief that makes important decisions concerning the city. The chief has final say in any legal disputes, and is the only person who has to pass new laws. Secium is a small enough city, so this sort of system works for them. In a larger city, this system would be quickly exploited.

      <h2>Exports</h2>
      <p>
        Secium residents are talented at pottery. These pots are said to contain the lost spirits of the dead, and are more commonly known as ghost pots. While the ghost pots themselves are only sought after locally, Secium exports other forms of pottery such as vases, bowls, and plates. Secium's oasis provides them with enough clay for their pottery. In addition to pottery, Secium exports a type of leather made from cacti, that is commonly used to make glamorous purses. They also export the wood created from the wood cactus.

      <h2>Plants</h2>
      <p>
        The Arena Arida Ligna, locally known as the wood cactus, is one of the deserts most common cacti. It is the main source of material and textiles in this area. It it shaped like a sphere and holds water inside it. If cut in half and dried out it can be turned into a bowl. If cut into strips and flattened, it is as tough as wood, and can be used to build buildings. This material can also be used for other things, like spoons and forks. If dried out, the cactus' spikes fall out and can be collected and used as jewelry. Desert dwellers also use this plant as a way to store water, as it contains quite a bit of water in the center of the plant.

       Si is the patron god of Secium. She is not as well known as the other gods, but she does not let that deter her. She is only worshipped by Secium, and is unknown in other countries. She is said to appear as an apparation, or in her human appearance. Si appears with white hair, and always wears black. She is known by the other gods, but they think she is sort of creepy. They are wary of how she uses their dead worshippers to better her own people, and they are very busy trying to shut those soul's powers down before Si overuses their own powers. Making the "Ghost Pots" are seen as an act of worship by the people who live in Secium. In honor of Si, they release a spirit each year on the sixth day of the sixth month. This holiday is called the "Breaking of the Pot" and the best potter each year is selected to break one of their pots. It's seen as an incredible honor to be selected. Si's temple is made entirely out of clay, and is located in the northern-most part of Secium. It looks like a massive, ornately decorated, pot.

      <h2>The Enorvat</h2>

      <p>The Enorvat is a type of giant lizard that lives in the Aidec Desert. It is feared amongst Secium residents, and they warn their children that if they misbehave, they'll be eaten by the enorvat. However, even though they are feared, most Secium residents have not seen the enorvat, because they only come out at night. They are rare, because they have a hard time finding food in the desert. They used to eat smaller desert creatures, but turned to people to survive. Like lizards, they can only die if someone cuts off their head entirely. They can grow back their tail and legs. The enorvat appears cute to draw humans, especially young children in. As they grow older, they grow a longer tail. Like a snake, they can use their tail to strangle their prey. They swallow their prey whole. The enorvat can camoflauge to sneak up on prey.</p>

      <h2>Secium</h2>
      <p>
        The people of Secium live in an established desert town. The founder of Secium founded it right next to an oasis, so that the inhabitants have a constant source of water. Additionally, the palm trees near Secium provude them with coconuts, which they use to make coconut milk, coconut oil, and a variety of other coconut products. The people of Secium are talented at pottery, and they use a special type of pottery to make a pot that holds a lost spirit that is roaming the desert. Their connection to the god, Si, allows them to make this type of magical pot. These pots are considered sacred, because they increase their connection to their patron god. The ghosts trapped in the pots allow their holder to access the powers that the ghost could have accessed in their lifetime. Secium sees several outsiders a year, but because of the brutality of the desert, Secium is not a center of trade like the port cities.
