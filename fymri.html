     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>Fymri, also known as the Isle of Fymri, is an island located in the top left of the world of Faymere. The only way to reach there is across the ocean. Fymri's capital city is Saltu. Fymri's patron god is El, the god of the earth. They are a farming oriented country, and most people are farmers. They place emphasis on making the most of the space that you have since they are located on an island with limited space. Their earth powers allow them to build multi-story farms full of many, many crops. </p>

    <section class="government">
      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>
        Fymri is run by a single council of 5 people. This council changes people every 6 years, and is encouraged to have an even split of genders. To qualify to be on the council, you must be nominated by at least 50 people, and then you must sit through an interview by past council members. You must also have been working in government for at least 2 years.

      <h2>Exports</h2>
      <p>
        Fymri is a farming island, so they supply the produce for the majority of Faymere. Fymri specializes in meat products, as well as eggs, cheese, and milk. They also export fruits and vegetables that do not grow very well in other climates. Fymri's soil is fertile enough that they can grow as much food as they like. The only limiting factor is space, but they have figured out how to create multi-story farms thanks to their earth powers. They also fuel most of Faymere's baking hobby.

    </section>
    
    <section class="plants">
      <h2>Plants</h2>
      <p>
        Fymri grows a special type of wheat, called earthwheat, which is easily processed into a type of flour. This flour is used in baking and cooking all across Faymere. Additionally, the earthweat is very space efficent, as it grows up, not around. It can grow up to 5 feet tall, and it produces a lot of wheat. One earthwheat plant can be turned into almost 50 bags of flour. Fymri also grows the simple-sugar plant, in the northern part of the island, which has a more tropical climate. The simple-sugar plant is processed into a fine sugar that is also used in baking.

       <p>El is the patron god of Fymri, as well as the god of the earth. His other domains are farming, baking, and the harvest. He is one of the main three gods, and is worshipped in both Fymri and Dyrrith. He often appears as a human, with tan skin, brown hair, and striking green eyes. By worshipping El, he grants them the power to lift earth easily, and build natural structures from the earth. He has also blessed the land of Fymri with fertile soil. He is also said to have created the Highfall waterfalls with the help from Lu. He's best friends with Lu, and he likes to hang out with Fi and Ki. He's very oblivious and humorous. Vy sees him as sort of immature. To worship El, people leave out fruit and baked goods for him to eat. His main temple is structured like a cottage in the woods, and has a bakery inside of it. He gets mad easily, and is said to be the causer of earthquakes, and his anger formed the Kiassi Alps and the Calis Cliffs. </p>
