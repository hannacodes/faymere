      <h2>Plants</h2>
      
      Levania is known for their oak trees, and they use oak wood in practically all of their buildings. Their oak trees are prized, and certain trees are said to have been blessed by Lu.
      <br>
 Levania has several local plants, but one of the most important and prized is the Curtonus Arboreus, also known as the clear-oval plant is an extremely common, huge plant and can be found anywhere near the sea. It blooms once a year, for 5 months.
It has large, oval leaves, which are usually emerald. It also grows quite large flowers, which can be purple, dark orange and light bronze. These plants grow in large groups, but it's easy to control and maintain their growth.
They can be used to clean land. As a defense mechanism, the Curtonus Arboreus is poisonous for most creatures.
They rely on water currents to carry their seeds away to reproduce. Once pollinated, they grow fairly large, delicious nuts.

       Lu is the patron god of Levania, and also the god of the sea. Their other domains are the ocean, water, fish, and exploration. They are mainly worshipped by the Levanians, but are also known across Faymere, especially in Dyrrith. They are said to appear as the water itself, but also has a human form. Their humaniod appearance is blonde with tan skin, and they have clear shining blue eyes, said to be almost a window into the ocean. They're very talkative with the other gods, and they're known to be comfortable with everyone. To worship Lu, Levanians feed the fish and make sure not to pollute the ocean. Levanians also have a small fish in their homes, kept as a pet. This fish they use as a messenger to Lu, and they tell it their prayers in hopes that Lu will answer them. Lu represents the seafaring aspect of Levania's culture. In honor of Lu, the Levanians have them as the figurehead on their boats. The main temple that honors Lu is built on a boat, and is permanently docked in Lenora. Lu is said to have created the entire ocean, and Levanians are careful not to anger the ocean with their magic.  </p>

     <p>
       Princess Vivianne Aria Lynn Levania wasborn to the Levanian royal family, in a position of power. She was raised by her mother and her nanny. Since she was royalty, her childhood was very sheltered, and thus, her only friend was the daughter of the head knight. She is educated in diplomacy, reading and writing in many languages, battle strategy, water magic, and royal etiquette. She struggles with making friends and combat. She's a born diplomat, but will try negotiation over anything else, even if it puts her in danger. She wants to do something meaningful with her powers, both magical and political. She loves to swim, as it connects her more with Lu. Even though shes a diplomat, she's actually really shy. She's generally well liked by her subjects. She's the most powerful water-magic user in her kingdom, and has even become more powerful than the king. She's an only child, so she will inherit the throne when she is older.
