     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>
       Dyrrith is the smallest country in Faymere. It is surrounded by rivers and is best known for its waterfalls. Dyrrith's capital city is Highfall, and almost everyone in Dyrrith lives in Highfall. Dyrrith's people each celebrate a different god, but usually pick one of the main three, Lu, the god of the ocean, Vy, the god of the air, or El, the god of the earth. Dyrrith is the only country that does not have a patron god, and therefore all of the people have slightly different elemental powers. Dyrrith is seen as the melting pot of Faymere, as it is the most diverse country in Faymere.

       Government
     </h2>
     <p>
       Dyrrith's government is a democracy. There are 5 members that are voted in to make the big decisions, and each law must be passed by the council, which is comprised of 20 people. 12 members on the council must agree to pass a law before it goes into effect. The council's members change every 3 years, and no council member can have a consequtive term. They can alternate terms, but they cannot have two terms in a row. The 5 head members change every 2 years, and no person can be on the head council for more than 1 term every 6 years.The minimum age for a council member is 25, and to be on head council, a member must be on the regular council first, or have ran for a council position. Only Highfall has a mayor, because it is the only town big enough to have one.

     <p>Dyrrith is well known for their pinkcherry trees. They bare fruit in the spring, and bloom in winter. This fruit tastes like a normal cherry, but is much sweeter, and tastes even better when baked. They can also be used as a pink dye. They are only found in Dyrrith, and are highly sought after in other countries, especially Kevroc. In addition to the pinkcherry, Highfall is home to the top metalworker in Faymere. People travel from all over just to get weapons made by him, and he supplies the crowns and tiaras to all the kingdoms.</p>

     <h2>Common Plants</h2>
     <p>
       While they are best known for their pinkcherry trees, Dyrrith is also home to the Glidowth, a water loving plant that only grows around rivers. They especially love waterfalls, and are incredibly common near Glidowth Falls. The Glidowth can be used for medicine, as it has a numbing property that is an especially good anesthetic. Doctors mash it into a paste and apply it topically. It's leaves are orange, and can also be used as a dye.

        Highfall is the only river port city in Faymere. They use the river for transportation. Highfall is best known for their three waterfalls, Glidowth Falls, Maltrie Falls, and Feather Falls. Glidowth Falls is named for the glidowth plant that surrounds the base of the falls. Maltrie Falls is the tallest waterfall, and was named after the founder of Highfall's tallest friend, Lucy Maltrie. Feather Falls are the quietest falls, and are also said to have the most gentle waters. As the founder of Highfall wrote in her journals, "The water of the third waterfall feels like feathers falling on your skin." Highfall makes a lot of money from the tourist industry, as people love to visit and hike to the top of the falls.

       <p>
         Ellie Black was a well known explorer from Levania. She was known for her courage and perserverance. However, she was known to be overconfident in her own abilities. She wanted to find a place where her ancestors could grow up, and she also wanted to found something that would last beyond her lifetime. She was also a skilled fighter, and she loved to go hiking. She also liked to go hunting, and those skills came in handy when she went on her famous trip to discover Dyrrith. She was also a natural leader, but she was really stubborn, and it took a while to convince her to change her opinion. She never got good at magic, and she was one of the only Levanians who was respected for not knowing magic. She saw the gods as something trival, but never disrespected anyone for choosing to believe in them. The gods saw her as someone beyond their control, and respected her opinion, but never granted her powers either.
